# RepositoryOfKnowledge

Welcome to the **Repository of Knowledge**! 

The goal of this repo is to provide a fully-functional, self-hosted "knowledge" server. What is a knowledge server, you ask? *Excellent* question! A knowledge server is a term I made up that essentially means a server that allows you to access your accumulated "knowledge". Essentially, the goal is to have a browser-based web application that allows you to view, download, manage or delete various, accumulated notes, videos, slideshows, and more! This can be useful for:
- College students saving their old class slides because they know they'll need to reference it
- Backing up your drafts/notes on your own private server
- Saving videos that you love

The best part? The goal is to make your data 100% encrypted. In other words, even if someone were to access your personal webpage, they couldn't get access to any of your data BECAUSE there are safeguards in place. 

Additionally, I'd like to make this:
- fully customizable
- lightweight (so you can run it on a low-power SBC, like a Raspberry Pi!)
- compatible with ALL file formats
- completely open-source
- ***extremely fast***

Finally, I will be attempting to integrate AI/ML to help auto-categorize notes, sort uploads automatically, reduce data on disk if possible, etc - though, to help guarantee security/privacy, I'm hoping to use 100% small/lean on-device models. 

That's the basic idea! If you'd like to contribute, please shoot me an email using the email address on my profile and we can discuss it. Hoping to average around 10 commits a week with this project, since there's a LOT to do. 

Long-term goals DO include supporting Windows and macOS, but for now my focus will be Linux.
